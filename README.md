# samueldple/material-color

An Elm package for material colors.

It is designed to integrate easily with [rtfeldman/elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css) or with any library that accepts colours in hex notation.

In addition to the material spec colours, white, and black, it allows custom colours to be used via hex values.
